# ARDUINO-MovementDetector

The arduino movement detector is based on ultrasounds to detect the presence of objects in a range and beeps with a frequency proportional to the distance to the detected object. 

In the v2. the arduino board controls a servo-motor by using 4 mosfets in forming an H-bridge (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H_bridge)   

See demonstration videos for examples.
